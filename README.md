Goal: an assembler that will process one or more .asm files 
containing MIPS assembly into two binary files: one containing 
the binary encoded instructions, and another containing the contents of static memory 

Main program will be written in C++. It should compile with a MakeFile, and the final target should be an executable called “assemble”.
